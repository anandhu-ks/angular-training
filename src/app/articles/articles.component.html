      Firstly, a small digression. The easiest way to make a decision is to look
      back at history. Lets take a trip down nostalgia lane. Back in the early
      2000â€™s there were two UI frameworks that JAVA had. One was AWT, which was
      a way to build UIs for multiple Operating systems while still maintaining
      the look and feel of the OS. Each OS would have its own components which
      were mapped back to the AWT components created using the AWT framework.
      Java then decided to come up with its own rendering component library
      called Swing. What Swing did was handle its own rendering instead of
      relying on the underlying OS components. Swing won the battle and soon AWT
      disappeared off the face of the earth. How is this relevant? Why am I
      digressing? If you have been following the React Native vs Flutter debate,
      this should be familiar to you. React Native components gets transpiled
      down to either IOS or android components whereas Flutter renders its own
      UI using its own rendering engine based on a 2d rendering engine called
      SKIA.(Similar to how a game engine does its own rendering).It still relies
      on Material design (Android style) Widgets and Cupertino (Apple Style)
      widgets to imitate the native platform pixel perfect look and feel. If we
      look back at the Swing vs AWT battle as reference, Flutter will probably
      win here.
